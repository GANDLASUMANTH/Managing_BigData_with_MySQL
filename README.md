# MySQL-Exercises-with-Dognition-Database
Analyzing the dognition dataset to uncover trends and develop insights into how Dognition can incentivize users into taking more personality assessment tests

# Problem Statement
Dognition is a company that helps dog owners around the world to learn more about their dogs.
One of the primary motives of Dognition is to learn more about dogs by collecting more data on them in order to publish research papers.
In order to do so, Dognition would want their users to complete more tests which profile every dog under a certain personality.

# Main Objective
The main business objective of this analysis is to uncover insights to find a way to increase the test completion rate on the Dognition platform.

# Recommendations

Dognition should focus its strategy on the US market as it is their primary market. Once they have set up a model that works, they could move on to other countries.

Investing in social media presence and advertising channels based on segmentation could be a positive point of leverage for the company.

The Free start promotion should be discontinued as it leads to subpar completion rates. The Free Dognition test strategy (which gives users all 20 tests for free) should experiment with larger samples as it shows promise and could be coupled with a free month as an added incentive.

The highest number of tests are completed on Sunday, specifically in the evening (7-9 pm) when considered throughout the week. Targetting reminders or encouragement messages during that timeframe could lead to better results.
